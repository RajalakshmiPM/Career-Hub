        <h3>1. Is choosing a write career is an important aspect in life?</h3>

        <p>Well, I would definitely say yes! You get a tons of definitions in many websites for the word <q> Career </q>. But now the question is, why that is so important to be considered before we choose our occupation. A career is often composed of the jobs held, titles earned and work accomplished over a long period of time. At same time you have to make sure that you are happy with what you are doing. So the career is not only about choosing a <i> career </i> but it's all about how you would you love to live your life.</p> <br>

        <h3>2. How I choosed my career?</h3>

        <p>Guess what!!!  Even I did my B.E in EEE and I changed my career to become a Web Developer.
        This page is highly recommended for studying/graduated students.<br> 
        Letâ€™s start,<br>  
        Here are some list below for career after Engineering</p>

        <p> From the above table we got to know, what are all the options we have after B.E. Now lets discuss one by one.
        For people who are studying, you have a super precious time to choose a proper career compared to people who have already been graduated, but no worries "chill" even I took 2 years to decided what I really wanted in my life, slowly my previous work gave me all the motivation to do something better than what I was going through.</p><br>

        <h3>3. So after engineering you will be having 2 options either you can prepare for campus placements or to any other dream company or else you can do master's.</h3>

        <ol>

        <li><p>If you want to get into good company, you have to prepare for interview rounds/tests like quantitative aptitude, technical aptitude, GD and other general soft skills. For service based companies if you get ready for these stuff its good enough. For some companies technical aptitude is excluded.</p> <b>Visit <a href="http://www.sahicareer.com/">www.sahicareer.com</a> for online aptitude test</b></li>
    
        <li><p>If you are aiming for product based companies like Google, Microsoft etc must prepare for Gate, since most of the question that appear in technical aptitude/test will be of Gate exams based.</p> <b>Visit <a href="http://www.indiabix.com">www.indiabix.com</a> for all details and interview questions regarding Product based companines</b></li> 
        
        <li><p>If you would like to continue your studies and willing to choose ME/MTech again you have to prepare for Gate. If you're willing to get into reputational college your Gate scores must be good.</p> <b>Visit <a href="gate.iitm.ac.in">gate.iitm.ac.in</a> for all details regarding Gate exams</b></li>
        
        <li><p>MS@UA, Canada, etc this will be your other option if you are willing to do study abroad and for this you have to learn their communial languages like french, german and so on.. it completely depends on your GRE,GMAT scores</p><b>Visit <a href="http://studyabroad.shiksha.com">studyabroad.shiksha.com</a> for all details regarding Colleges and fees to study in abroad</b></li>
        
        <li><p>MBA is basically for people who are more interested in maganement jobs. Again it is well and good if you're doing in reputated college and the exams that need to be prepared for this degree would be CAT, MAT, PGCET, XMAT, and so on... </p> <b>Visit <a href="edu.byjus.com">edu.byjus.com</a> for all details regarding MBA exams, colleges and placements</b></li><br>

        </ol>           

         <h3>4. Now let's answer the most awaiting questionWhat would be my career options if either I do not get placed in any company or I'm not interested in higher studies?</h3>

        <p>Well for this question I have a real creepy answer, most importantly before you do anything you must belive that <q>everything happens for good</q>. Now read this carefully. If you're looking for a lucrutive jobs, there are plenty of jobs in IT field. What you must do is start coding, This will definitely help you to land up a decent job. If are good with basic coding skills and have good communication and interpersonal skills, belive me you are almost there to start your life. Do not look at the salary initially, you need gain enough experience to prove yourself best in your place, later you can charge for your talent. There are tons of courses and increasing need for experts. Get the clarity and start... </p><br>
